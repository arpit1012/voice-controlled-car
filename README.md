# Voice-Controlled-Robot
The bot recognizes basic voice commands like move forward, move backward, turn left, turn right. Also, it has obstacle avoidance.
That is, it can avoid obstacles in between its path. We used ultrasonic sensors in front and back of the bot to accomplish this task.

It also has a 180 degree radar system with range of around 1.5 feet, we used Processing IDE for diplaying curves and lines, a 12g servo motor with a ultrasonic sensor attached on it. 

For voice recognition, we used the porcupine library. We trained the keywords like 'forward, backward, left, right' using this library.We used HC-05 bluetooth module for commnication between bot and microphone(laptop).

We made the bot chassis using 5mm acrylic sheet 25cm x 20cm, used two 300 rpm 12v dc motor, a L298N motor driver, arduino uno, a 11.1V 2200mAh Lipo battery, a power bank to power the arduino.
